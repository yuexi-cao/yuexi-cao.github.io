I am currently a senior undergraduate student at [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I anticipate obtaining my Bachelor’s Degree by June 2026.

My research lies in applied microeconomics, concentrating on economic development, innovation, and policy impacts. I'm also working as a research assistant (RA) under [Prof. Puyang Sun](https://puyangsun.weebly.com/) at [Renmin University](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/jszy/fae5ef93a4a642bf84dfdcb8c7064dd6.htm). I'm deeply interested in exploring how economic policies influence social welfare during China’s economic transformation.
