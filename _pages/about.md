I am currently a senior undergraduate student at [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I anticipate obtaining my Bachelorâ€™s Degree by june 2026.

My research interests focus on applird micro, with topics focusing economic development, innovation, and policy impacts. I've explored how corporate networks enhance innovation through a stacked Difference-in-Differences model and investigated the effects of liberalized home purchase rights on migrant worker citizenization using a DID framework with instrumental variables. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of economic policies and social welfare, especially in the context of China's economic transformation.
